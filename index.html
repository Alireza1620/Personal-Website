                    <h2>FRONT-END DESIGN</h2>
                    <p>A front-end designer’s goal is to make websites that are easily understood and accessible. This
                        includes
                        cross-browser, cross-platform, and cross device testing. As a designer I am concerned with the
                        content,
                        colors, theme, accessibility, page loading, usability, and most importantly the end-users
                        experience.</p>

                    <h2>RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN</h2>
                    <p>is an approach that is aimed at providing the best viewing experience regardless of the device,
                        browser,
                        platform, or resolution. Responsive Web Design (RWD) provides an easy way to read and navigate
                        the website
                        with minimal resizing, panning, and scrolling.</p>

                    <h2>INTERFACE DESIGN</h2>
                    <p>is the design of websites, applications, and software with the focus on the user’s experience and
                        interaction. The purpose is to make an efficient and simple interface where the user doesn’t
                        have to think
                        about how to accomplish their goals. This design process has to balance technical functionality
                        and visual
                        design that will adapt to the wide variety of users and needs</p>
